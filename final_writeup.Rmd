### Final
I made a few changes to my schema. Both *Seed Indoor* and *Seed Outdoor* required an extra characteristic, *version*. This referred to the type of the seed: an actual seed, or a tuber, or a bulb, or a crown (for asparagus) etc. This was required because some plants had multiple options for type of seed, that had different characteristics in terms of when to plant. For instance, for onions, you can plant onion seeds, onion sets, or onion bunches: these are all different versions of baby onions you can plant.  

I also had to change day to *start date* and add in *through date* for *Seed Indoor* and *Seed Outdoor*. This clarified which days of the month a plant could be planted. This was required because some plants could only be planted in, for instance, July, up until the 15th and not after. Or, some could only be planted after the 15th. So that needed to be clarified. This was not required for *Starts*, since they did not have any of those qualifiers.

# Data population process
I populated this data by creating csvs of each table. Obviously this would not work for a larger dataset, but in this case it was simple.

The two tables for *Season* and *Month* were quite simple, so I just wrote those as csvs by hand.

Most of my data came from the Portland Nursery reference (sample shown below). So, my first step was taking that pdf, and converting it to excel. 

![Portland Nursery document](portland_nursery_sample.png){#id .class width=50% height=50%}
  
Then from there, I separated the information in it out into my tables: Vegetables, starts, seed_indoor, seed_outdoor. This was a bit laborsome in terms of data cleaning. I made messy versions of each table, and then used Python to clean them up. For instance, rather than figuring out what the *veg_id* was for each vegetable in each table, I made a Python dictionary of the vegetables, mapping name to ID, so that I could pull it out more easily. 

A sample of my Python code for *Seed outdoor* is below:
```{python eval = FALSE}
import csv

with open("veg_table.csv", "r") as veg_table:
	veg_table_reader = csv.DictReader(veg_table)
	veg_name_to_id = {}
	for row in veg_table_reader:
		veg_name_to_id[row["name"]] = row["veg_id"]

with open("seed_outdoor.csv", "r") as seed_outdoor_table:
	seed_outdoor_table_reader = csv.DictReader(seed_outdoor_table)
	with open("seed_outdoor_edited.csv", "w") as seed_outdoor_edited:
		fieldnames = ["veg_id", "version", "month_id", "start_date", "through_date", "best"]
		seed_outdoor_table_writer = csv.DictWriter(seed_outdoor_edited, fieldnames = fieldnames)
		seed_outdoor_table_writer.writeheader()
		for row in seed_outdoor_table_reader:
			ID = veg_name_to_id[row['Veg_clean']]
			version = row['Version']
			month_id = row['MonthID']
			start_date = row['Start_day']
			through_date = row['Through']
			best = row['Best']

			if version == "":
				version = "seeds"
			if best == "":
				best = "No"


			if through_date == "":
				if month_id in ["4", "6", "9", "11"]:
					through_date = "30"
				elif month_id == "2":
					through_date = "28"
				else:
					through_date = "31"

			seed_outdoor_table_writer.writerow({"veg_id":ID, "version":version, 
			  "month_id":month_id, "start_date":start_date, 
			  "through_date":through_date, "best":best})

```

The only information that was not in the Portland Nursery document was information on sunlight and harvest dates. For sunlight, I used other resources from the Portland Nursery website. For harvest, I used reference 3 from the Spruce Eats.

Once I had these four cleaned up csvs, I populated them in postgres by using the import tool in the GUI. I would have liked to do this from terminal instead, but I could not due to user privileges.

13. What is the best method/month to plant arugula?
The complexity of these solutions shows that perhaps that "best" variable should be rethought. But the queries below do work. It is difficult because there can be multiple best months to plant, and multiple different methods (seed indoor/outdoor, starts).
```{sql eval = FALSE}
SELECT si_month_name, so_month_name, s_month_name
FROM 

(SELECT v.veg_id, m.name as si_month_name 
FROM vegetables as v, seed_indoor as si, month as m
WHERE v.veg_id = si.veg_id AND si.month_id = m.month_id AND 
si.best = 'Yes' AND v.name = 'Arugula') as si_month_table FULL OUTER JOIN 

(SELECT v.veg_id, m.name as so_month_name
FROM vegetables as v, seed_outdoor as so, month as m
WHERE v.veg_id = so.veg_id AND so.month_id = m.month_id AND 
so.best = 'Yes' AND v.name = 'Arugula') as so_month_table ON 
si_month_table.veg_id = so_month_table.veg_id FULL OUTER JOIN

(SELECT v.veg_id, m.name as s_month_name
FROM vegetables as v, starts as s, month as m
WHERE v.veg_id = s.veg_id AND s.month_id = m.month_id AND 
s.best = 'Yes' AND v.name = 'Arugula') as s_month_table ON 
si_month_table.veg_id = s_month_table.veg_id;
```
Gives us: 

 si_month_name | so_month_name | s_month_name 
---------------+---------------+--------------
               | September     | 
               | August        | 
               | March         | 
               | February      | 
(4 rows)

Answer: Best is to seed outdoor in August, September or in February, March. This seems odd to me but if you look at the table from Portland Nursery that's what you see!

14. When is it best method/month to plant bell peppers?  
```{sql eval = FALSE}
SELECT si_month_name, so_month_name, s_month_name
FROM 

(SELECT v.veg_id, m.name as si_month_name 
FROM vegetables as v, seed_indoor as si, month as m
WHERE v.veg_id = si.veg_id AND si.month_id = m.month_id AND 
si.best = 'Yes' AND v.name = 'Peppers') as si_month_table FULL OUTER JOIN 

(SELECT v.veg_id, m.name as so_month_name
FROM vegetables as v, seed_outdoor as so, month as m
WHERE v.veg_id = so.veg_id AND so.month_id = m.month_id AND 
so.best = 'Yes' AND v.name = 'Peppers') as so_month_table ON 
si_month_table.veg_id = so_month_table.veg_id FULL OUTER JOIN

(SELECT v.veg_id, m.name as s_month_name
FROM vegetables as v, starts as s, month as m
WHERE v.veg_id = s.veg_id AND s.month_id = m.month_id AND 
s.best = 'Yes' AND v.name = 'Peppers') as s_month_table ON 
si_month_table.veg_id = s_month_table.veg_id;
```
Gives us:  

 si_month_name | so_month_name | s_month_name 
---------------+---------------+--------------
 February      |               | May
 March         |               | May
 February      |               | June
 March         |               | June
(4 rows)

Answer: Best is to seed indoor in February or March, or to use starts in May or June.

```
Answer:  12-18 inches

16. What plant spacing should be used for green onions?  
```{sql eval = FALSE}
SELECT v.plant_spacing
FROM vegetables as v
WHERE v.name = 'Green onions';
```
Answer: 2 inches

17. What vegetables should have 12-18’’ row spacing?

```
Answer: Onions

19. What vegetables can be planted any time of year? 
Interpreting this as can be seeded outdoors or planted as a starter during any month.
```{sql eval = FALSE}
SELECT v.name
FROM vegetables as v, seed_outdoor as so
WHERE v.veg_id = so.veg_id
GROUP BY v.name
HAVING COUNT(*) = 12
UNION
SELECT v.name
FROM vegetables as v, starts as s
WHERE v.veg_id = s.veg_id
GROUP BY v.name
HAVING COUNT(*) = 12;
```
Answer:  Parsley, Oregano, Chives, Rosemary

20. What vegetables can only be seeded indoors? 
I am interpreting this as meaning they can be seeded indoor, but not outdoors. So, not looking at starts at all.
```{sql eval = FALSE}
SELECT DISTINCT v.name
FROM vegetables as v, seed_indoor as si
WHERE v.veg_id = si.veg_id AND v.veg_id NOT IN (
SELECT v.veg_id
FROM vegetables as v, seed_outdoor as so
WHERE v.veg_id = so.veg_id)
```
Answer:  Artichoke, Eggplant, Peppers, Tomatillos, Tomatoes
